This whole software structure is supported by four significant pillars, namely, the requirement engineering process. In this context, functional and non-functional requirements are the bricks and cements that provide strength to the architecture. Successive layers of design, implementation, and testing form the construction of the overall software system. The base established during the requirement engineering phase of the software development cycle, therefore, has to be strong to hold the whole structure of the software. Regarding this, requirement engineers are confronting a number of tasks for developing appropriate and effective solutions of software. This paper will review the challenges faced in requirement engineering, relating to the development of software applications and choices of appropriate COTS components. Such challenges include the interpretation of stakeholders requirements, deriving workable products from incomplete or inconsistent process descriptions, verification and validation of requirements, large-scale data classification, modeling, and choice of COTS products with minimal modification to the original requirements. Along with pointing out these challenges, the paper also reviews critically the existing literature in order to explore the identification of the challenges by other researchers. More importantly, it proposes a model that identifies seven recurring challenges during the requirement engineering phase, which are grouped into certain problem areas. This is integrated with prior research in order to highlight the challenges which may not have been covered in earlier works. With these types of investment in engineering challenges of requirements, the engineers are able to provide a solid foundation for their software and thereby avoid failures in projects.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"><i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |

These systems struggle to detect novel and sophisticated attacks, particularly zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APT). This paper presents a novel intrusion detection algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - SN-CNN (SecureNet-CNN), designed to address these challenges by analyzing network traffic patterns in real-time and identifying malicious activities. The proposed CNN-based SN-CNN (SecureNet-CNN) system leverages flow-based feature extraction to represent network traffic as images, allowing the model to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw network data. Our approach is tested on benchmark datasets, such as NSL-KDD, where it outperforms traditional machine learning models in accuracy, precision, recall, and overall robustness. The CNN-based IDS achieves an accuracy of 98.5%, demonstrating superior detection of both known and unknown attack patterns while reducing false positives and improving scalability. This research highlights the potential of CNNs to revolutionize network security by providing adaptive, real-time intrusion detection, and lays the foundation for future work on deep learning in cybersecurity.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"><i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |

People living with HIV (PLWH) are at an elevated risk of heart attacks, even in the absence of traditional risk factors. Some antiretroviral therapies, particularly protease inhibitors, can adversely affect heart health. HIV is typically diagnosed through blood tests, though CT and MRI scans can assist in identifying related complications. Advanced algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed in image processing to detect HIV-related abnormalities. CNNs, achieving detection rates of 90-95%, are particularly effective in analyzing CT data for HIV/AIDS conditions. MRI scans, processed with software such as FSL and AFNI, are useful for studying structural and functional brain changes related to HIV. Blood tests including antigen/antibody and RNA tests, exhibit nearly 100% accuracy in detecting HIV at various stages. Over time, the incidence of HIV/AIDS has significantly declined, with a peak in 1997, followed by a steady reduction by 2019. The study emphasizes the importance of combining diagnostic imaging with advanced algorithms and reliable blood tests to accurately detect and monitor HIV-related health issues.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"><i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |

In order to improve security measures, anomalous behaviors are found, categorized, and assessed through security analysis and linked device monitoring. Potential risks are warned of by a warning notification system, and persistent threats are countered and prevented from connecting to the public Wi Fi network. It explores how to use external threat feeds and repositories to improve the systems threat detection capabilities. It also goes into the field of threat intelligence integration. It aims to increase public Wi Fi networks ability to promptly detect and counter emerging cyberthreats by working with industry partners and utilizing worldwide threat information sources.

Traditional clock synchronization methods often require frequent resynchronization, leading to significant energy consumption and reduced network lifetime. This survey investigates the potential of deep learning-based predictive models to enhance energy-efficient clock synchronization in WSNs. By leveraging historical data to predict future clock drifts, these models enable sensor nodes to adjust their synchronization frequency dynamically, reducing the need for constant resynchronization and conserving energy. We provide a comprehensive review of existing clock synchronization techniques and highlight their limitations in the context of energy efficiency. The survey further explores various deep learning architectures and predictive modeling techniques that can be applied to this problem, assessing their effectiveness in different WSN scenarios. Our analysis reveals that deep learning-based predictive models offer a promising approach for achieving energy-efficient clock synchronization, with the potential to significantly extend the operational lifetime of WSNs without compromising synchronization accuracy. The survey concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the role of predictive modeling in the development of next-generation energy-efficient WSNs.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |
