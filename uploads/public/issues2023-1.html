Coupled with advances in software and theory, the range of classification techniques has also increased. Network operators can predict demands in future traffic to high accuracy and better identify anomalous behavior. Multiple machine learning tools have been developed in this field and each have had varying degrees of success. Network traffic classification is the operation of giving appropriate identification to every traffic flow through a network. Several methods have been applied in the past, to achieve network traffic classification including port-based, payload- based, behavior based and so on. These methods have been found some limitation or the other. Nowadays, attention is now on Machine Learning (ML) methods that rely on the statistical properties of the traffic flows generated. However, ML methods do not perform well when confronted with large-scale traffic data having large number of features and instances.. In this study, network traffic classification using ML methods is demonstrated from two perspectives: one that involves feature selection and one that does not. A number of performance metrics are considered including runtime, accuracy, recall, precision and F- score. . This paper presents the design and implementation of , a flow-based network traffic classifier for online applications. and uses three ML models, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for classifying the most popular online applications, including Amazon, Youtube, Google, Twitter, and manyothers.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |

The machine learning algorithm is trained with the sounds of coughs that enables the model to track the presence of covid in telephonic conversation records. The model is trained with the datasets and allowing the model to detect the cough sounds. The test is conducted with different set of conversation, thereby detecting the presence of asymptotic covid-19 infections in a novel way. The simulation is conducted in python environment to test the efficacy of the model against various recorded voice calls. The results of simulation shows that the proposed method achieves higher degree of accuracy in detecting the cough tones from the input datasets than other methods.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |

In case of an emergency or other times when a speech and a hearing-impaired person is travelling along with new people, communication with nearby people or conveying a message or asking some details becomes very difficult for them, so here we proposed a smart- talking system that assists dumb persons to convey their information to other people using Raspberry pi. The system makes use of a speaker, Raspberry pi, 3.5- inch RPi touch display, virtual keyboard and a power supply. The raspberry pi is used for controlling the system and processing the data. The system consists of a Python GUI application, which stores sentences that helps speech and hearing impaired convey basic messages to normal people. The system can also be remotely programmed by using a personal computer which has Advanced IP Scanner and MobaXterm software installed on it, thus it has an entirely operational smart speaking system to assist people with speech and hearing impairment, communicate with regular people using this simple system which is more flexible to feed and remove information as per the requirement of the current situation.')" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#abstractModal"><i class="fas fa-file-alt icon-blue"></i> Abstract</a> |

The outbreak has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. All the services are affected due to lockdown and fear of its spread. The first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were typically related to enlarged levels of distress and depressive and anxiety symptoms within the general population. Therefore, the one want to investigate and analyze the mental health status of public during the epidemic. To study the Psychological Impact such as prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among people at RMMCH in Annamalai University. To compare a case control study to these levels between 100 COVID affected cases and 100 public those who are not affect in COVID. The respondents in the target population were sampled by cluster sampling. The public responded to a questionnaire that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and also acquiring the public basic information. The Questionnaire including DASS-21 was conduct to evaluate the depression, anxiety and stress levels of among them. The Decision Tree classification technique has been used to classify the psychological factor and the depression, anxiety and stress Grades were correlated with each other and compared with age both among cases and controls. The grade of depression 68 % among COVID cases has been lesser 75 % than that of controls. Prevalence of Anxiety cases 60 % has slightly higher than controls 58 %. Stress prevalence among cases 42 % and the controls 41 % were same. Depression score mean of control was significantly greater than that of cases. There was no association between psychological factors with age in both cases and controls.
